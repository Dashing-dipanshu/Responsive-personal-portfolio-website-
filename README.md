one-page responsive portfolio website that incorporates Flexbox, CSS Grid, media queries, and animations to create a polished and interactive layout. Use Flexbox to manage alignment and spacing efficiently, and apply CSS Grid to structure at least one section of the page. Implement media queries for a mobile-first design, ensuring the layout adapts seamlessly to desktop, tablet, and mobile screens. Use relative units like rem, em, %, vw, and vh for consistent spacing and font sizing. Enhance interactivity by adding hover effects to navigation links and buttons, smoothing them with CSS transitions, and including at least one keyframe animation along with transition or transform effects on interactive elements.
